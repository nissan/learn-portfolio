# My Learning Portfolio
This is a repository I created to experiment while showcasing the bits of tech I am learning about while focused on building out a NextJS app commercially. 

The rest of the documentation is standard boilerplate for now. This site is automatically [deployed to Vercel](https://learn-portfolio.vercel.app/) when a commit is made to `main`

## Learnings so far
- Reactflow
- Zustand

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```



To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
